                <p>Study Space is an all in one productivity website. Our goal was to provide a
                    one-stop-shop so that students didn't have to sit down and open a ton of tabs just 
                    to do some school work. My main contributions were the Notes Page, the Calendar page, 
                    and the Home Page.

            <div class="projects">
                <img src="./imgs/shape.png" width="20%" />
                <p>This is a shape editor built in React using HTML's canvas. You can draw, 
                    transform, and color shapes, lines, and curves. You can also download the
                    image as a .jpg, .pdf, and .json as well as upload a .json to draw shapes.

                <img src="./imgs/JSA.png" width="20%" />
                <p>This is a simple 2D platformer built in Unity using C#. It was a group project 
                    in a freshman software engineering course. I built the start screen UI and did a lot
                    of work with the overall player functionality.

            <h2>RendezSNHU</h2>
            <div class="projects">
                <img src="./imgs/RendezSHNU.png" width="20%" />
                <p>RendezSHNU (a play on rendezvous) was intended to be a tool for students to set up 
                    events on campus. It was built in Xamarin, a cross-platfrom framework for building
                    native mobile apps on IOS and Android. None of us had any experience with Xamarin so
                    I ended up doing a lot of research and building the majority of the app. One teammate handled
                    the database, another did the sign-in work, I did the rest.
