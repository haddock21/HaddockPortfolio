                    <h2>Southern New Hampshire University</h2>
                    <p>I started my college journey at SNHU before transferring to UMass Lowell. At SNHU, the
                        Computer Science program was very group project-focused. Each semester, we picked a project that
                        interested us. Mine
                        included building a 2D game in Unity and creating a campus social app. That experience really
                        helped me get comfortable
                        with agile project management and taught me how to learn new skills on my own, since the
                        projects were mostly
                        student-driven.</p>

                    <h2>University of Massachusetts Lowell</h2>
                    <p>I transferred to UMass Lowell after two years at SNHU because I felt it would be more
                        challenging.
                        Since transferring, I have developed a deeper understanding of programming. I expanded my
                        knowledge of C and C++
                        while exploring new languages like Python, JavaScrip, and HTML/CSS. My project sequence course
                        was centered around
                        web development which culmanated in a website called Study Space. </p>

            <h1>Military Career</h1>
            <p>After graduating high school in 2016, I served four years on active duty in the U.S. Army as an Airborne
                Infantryman.
                That service took me around the world, but I was mainly stationed at Fort Bragg, NC, and deployed to
                Afghanistan. I
                am now a sergeant in the Rhode Island Army National Guard and have been serving there for about five
                years. I am a Squad Leader and a senior rated Jumpmaster. My
                time in the military has taught me the importance of teamwork, how to work in fast-paced environments
                and adhere
                to strict standards.</p>
